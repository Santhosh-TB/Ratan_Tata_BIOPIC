                    <p>Ratan Tata was born in Bombay, now Mumbai, during the British Raj, on 28 December 1937. He is the son of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naval_Tata" target="_blank"><b>Naval Tata</b></a> , who was born in <u>Surat</u> and later adopted into the Tata family, and Sooni Tata, the niece of Tata group founder Jamsetji Tata. Tata's biological grandfather, <big>Hormusji Tata</big>, was a member of the <i>Tata family by blood</i>.</p>
        
                    <p>In 1948, when Tata was 10, his <i><u>parents separated</u></i>, and he was subsequently raised and adopted by Navajbai Tata, his grandmother and widow of Ratanji Tata. He has a younger brother Jimmy Tata and a half-brother, Noel Tata, from Naval Tata's second marriage with Simone Tata, with whom he was raised.</p>
            
                     <p>He studied at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campion_School,_Mumbai" target=""> Campion School, Mumbai</a> till the 8th class. After which, he studied at the Cathedral and John Connon School in Mumbai, the <b>Bishop Cotton School</b> in Shimla, and the Riverdale Country School in New York City, which he graduated from in 1955. After graduating from high school, Tata enrolled in Cornell University, from which he graduated with a bachelor's degree in architecture in 1959. In 2008, Tata gifted Cornell $50 Million, becoming the largest international donor in the university's history.</p>

                    <p class="cp">In the 1970s, Tata was given a <u>managerial position</u> in the Tata group. He achieved initial success by turning the subsidiary <i>National Radio and Electronics (NELCO)</i> around, only to see it collapse during an economic slowdown. In 1991, <b><big>J. R. D. Tata</big></b>  stepped down as chairman of Tata Sons, naming him his successor. Initially, Tata faced stiff resistance from the heads of various subsidiaries, who had a large amount of operational freedom under the senior Tata's tenure.</p>

                    <p class="cp">In response, Tata implemented a number of policies designed to consolidate power, including the implementation of a retirement age, having subsidiaries report directly to the group office, and requiring subsidiaries to contribute their profit to building the Tata group brand. Tata prioritised innovation and delegated many responsibilities to younger talent. Under his leadership, overlapping operations between subsidiaries were streamlined into company-wide operations, with the group exiting unrelated businesses to take on globalisation.</p>

                    <p class="cp">During the 21 years Tata led the Tata Group, revenues grew over 40 times, and profit over 50 times. When he took over the company, sales overwhelmingly comprised commodity sales, but at the end of his tenure, the majority of sales came from brands. He had Tata Tea acquire <b><big>Tetley, Tata Motors acquire Jaguar Land Rover, and Tata Steel</big></b> acquire Corus. These acquisitions repositioned Tata from a largely India-centric group into a global business, with over 65% of revenues coming from operations and sales internationally.He also conceptualized and spearheaded the development of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tata_Nano" target="_blank"><b><big>Tata Nano</big></b></a> car, which helped put cars at a price-point within reach of the average Indian consumer. Tata Motors has since rolled out the first batch of Tigor Electric Vehicles from its Sanand Plant in Gujarat, which Tata has described as "fast-forward[ing] India's electric dream."</p>

                    <p class="cpp">Upon turning 75, Ratan Tata resigned his executive powers in the Tata group on 28 December 2012. An ensuing leadership crisis over his succession drew intense media scrutiny. The board of directors and legal division of the company refused to appoint his successor, <big>Cyrus Mistry</big>, a relative of Tata and the son of <b>Pallonji Mistry</b> of the Shapoorji Pallonji Group, which was the largest individual shareholder of the Tata group. On 24 October 2016, Cyrus Mistry was removed as chairman of Tata Sons, and Ratan Tata was made interim chairman. A selection committee, which included Tata as a member, was formed to find a successor. On 12 January 2017, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natarajan_Chandrasekaran" target="_blank">Natarajan Chandrasekaran</a> was named as the chairman of Tata Sons, a role he assumed in February 2017. In February 2017, Mistry was removed as a director for Tata Sons. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Company_Law_Appellate_Tribunal" target="_blank">National Company Law Appellate Tribunal later</a> found in December 2019 that the removal of Cyrus Mistry as the chairman of Tata Sons was illegal, and ordered that he be reinstated. On appeal, India's Supreme Court upheld the dismissal of Cyrus Mistry.</p>

                    <p class="cpp">Tata has also invested in multiple companies with his own wealth. He has invested in <big><u>Snapdeal</u></big> – one of India's leading e-commerce websites. In January 2016, he invested in Teabox, an online premium Indian Tea seller, and CashKaro.com, a discount coupons and cash-back website. He has made small investments in both early and late stage companies in India, such as INR 0.95 Cr in <b>Ola Cabs</b>. In April 2015, it was reported that Tata had acquired a stake in Chinese smartphone startup Xiaomi. In 2016, he invested in Nestaway an online real-estate portal that later acquired Zenify to start the online real-estate and pet-care portal, Dogspot. Tata also launched <big><u>India's companionship startup</u></big> for senior citizens, Goodfellows, in a bid to encourage intergenerational friendships."</p>
